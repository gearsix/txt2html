- rename writeP
- implement ol
- implement ul
- implement li
- implement h1
- implement h2
- test ast against just writing straight to buffer
- avoid recursion (unless needed) - slow
- test against test.txt, improve test.txt for catching edge-cases
- maybe rename to NAML (not another markup language)
