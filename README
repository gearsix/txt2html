txt2html
========

txt2html is a tool for converting text files to HTML.
Written as a exercise in writing a simple syntax parser.

The goal is to be simple and not to create set of syntax rules for another markup language - just to take conventions commonly found in .txt files and convert them to HTML. Which has just resulted in a subset of Markdown anyway.

If you're looking for a good tool that does the same job, I'd recommend cmark (https://github.com/commonmark/cmark).

usage
-----

	usage: txt2html [OPTIONS] FILE...

	Convert content in txt files to html.

	FILE...   A list of 1 filepaths that point to files to be converted to HTML

	OPTIONS
	-br           Treat newlines within paragraphs as line breaks.
	-v            Print verbose logs during runtime
	-h, --help    Print this message

syntax
------

The following rules from Markdown are followed:

- Paragraphs
- Heading 1
- Heading 2
- Ordered lists
- Unordered lists (using `*` and `-`)
- Pre blocks (only indented blocks)

notes
-----

- I made a point to avoid using recursion (which is typically how ast trees are built).
Partly as a challenge and partly because I thought I could get away without it.
- There could probably be a fair bit of cleanup but I've been checking the tool against Valgrind (both compiled with gcc and musl) to avoid memory leaks and other issues.
